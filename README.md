# petz-paintballz-gun
Web app using HTML5 + Java to draw and export LNZ Paint Ballz

## To-Do
- [ ] Double check that roll / pitch / yaw are actually correct (they're not)
- [ ] Allow comma-delimited LNZ input
- [ ] Make helper sphere less confusing
- [ ] Fix load from LNZ -- does not work if not normalized to rid any roll / pitch / yaw transformations
